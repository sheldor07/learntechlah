    <h2>What is web development?</h2>
<p>A web developer&rsquo;s job is to create websites. While their primary role is to ensure the website is visually appealing and easy to navigate, many web developers are also responsible for the website&rsquo;s performance and capacity.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Types of web developers</h3>
<p>Web developers usually fall under one of three categories: back-end developers, front-end developers, and full-stack developers. Some web developers also work as webmasters. Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at each of these roles.</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Back-end web developers</strong> create the website&rsquo;s structure, write code, and verify the code works. Their responsibilities also may include managing access points for others who need to manage a website&rsquo;s content.&nbsp;</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Front-end web developers</strong> work on the visual part of the website&mdash;the pages visitors see and interact with (also known as the user interface). They design the physical layout of each page, integrate graphics, and use HTML and JavaScript to enhance the site.

    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Full-stack developers</strong> do the work of both a back-end and front-end developer. These developers have the knowledge to build a complete website and may work for organizations that don&rsquo;t have the budget for a large website team. If you&apos;re interested in full-stack web development, consider earning <a href="https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-full-stack-cloud-developer" rel="" target="_self">IBM&apos;s Full-Stack Developer Professional Certificate</a>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Webmasters</strong> are essentially website managers. Their primary responsibility is to keep the website updated, ensuring that the links and applications on each page work properly</p>
    </li>
    
        <h3>Web developer career path</h3>
        <p>Many web developers start their careers with a single focus, usually front-end or back-end development. They may move on to be full-stack developers or explore careers in related fields, including project management, computer programming, or graphic design.&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>How much do web developers make?</h2>
        <p>The median annual salary for web developers in the US is $78,300, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) [<a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/web-developers.htm#tab-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1</a>]. However, web developers in the US can earn up to $249,297 according to Glassdoor salary insights [<a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/web-developer-salary-SRCH_KO0,13.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2</a>]. How much you earn will depend on many factors, including where you work, what industry you work in, and how much experience you have.</p>
        <p>BLS estimates 23 percent industry growth for web developers between 2021-2031, a faster-than-average rate compared to other occupations. One of the driving forces behind this increase in web development jobs is the growth of e-commerce. Companies are becoming more reliant on functioning websites that operate on multiple devices to do business.</p>
        <h2>How to become a web developer</h2>
        <p>A formal education isn&rsquo;t always necessary to become an entry-level web developer. Some web developers have an associate or <a href="https://www.coursera.org/articles/what-is-a-bachelors-degree" rel="" target="_self">bachelor&rsquo;s degree</a> in website design or <a href="https://www.coursera.org/articles/what-is-computer-science-degree" rel="" target="_self">computer science</a>, but others teach themselves how to code and design websites. While earning a degree can make you a more competitive candidate, a strong portfolio can go a long way toward validating your skills to potential employers.</p>
