            <h2>What is web development?</h2>
            <p>A web developer&rsquo;s job is to create websites. While their primary role is to ensure the website is
                visually appealing and easy to navigate, many web developers are also responsible for the
                website&rsquo;s
                performance and capacity.&nbsp;</p>
            <h3>Types of web developers</h3>
            <p>Web developers usually fall under one of three categories: back-end developers, front-end developers, and
                full-stack developers. Some web developers also work as webmasters. Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at
                each
                of these roles.</p>
            <p><br></p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Back-end web developers</strong> create the website&rsquo;s structure, write code, and
                        verify
                        the code works. Their responsibilities also may include managing access points for others who
                        need
                        to manage a website&rsquo;s content.&nbsp;</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><br></p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Front-end web developers</strong> work on the visual part of the website&mdash;the pages
                        visitors see and interact with (also known as the user interface). They design the physical
                        layout
                        of each page, integrate graphics, and use HTML and JavaScript to enhance the site. You can gain
                        essential front-end web development skills with <a

                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Full-stack developers</strong> do the work of both a back-end and front-end developer.
                        These
                        developers have the knowledge to build a complete website and may work for organizations that
                        don&rsquo;t have the budget for a large website team. If you&apos;re interested in full-stack
                        web
                        development, consider earning <a

                <li>
                    <p><strong>Webmasters</strong> are essentially website managers. Their primary responsibility is to
                        keep
                        the website updated, ensuring that the links and applications on each page work properly</p>
                </li>

                <h3>Web developer career path</h3>
                <p>Many web developers start their careers with a single focus, usually front-end or back-end
                    development.
                    They may move on to be full-stack developers or explore careers in related fields, including project
                    management, computer programming, or graphic design.&nbsp;</p>
                <h2>How much do web developers make?</h2>
                <p>The median annual salary for web developers in the US is $78,300, according to the Bureau of Labor
                    Statistics (BLS) [<a
                        href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/web-developers.htm#tab-1"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1</a>]. However, web developers in the US can earn up
                    to
                    $249,297 according to Glassdoor salary insights [<a
                        href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/web-developer-salary-SRCH_KO0,13.htm"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2</a>]. How much you earn will depend on many factors,
                    including where you work, what industry you work in, and how much experience you have.</p>
                <p>BLS estimates 23 percent industry growth for web developers between 2021-2031, a faster-than-average
                    rate
                    compared to other occupations. One of the driving forces behind this increase in web development
                    jobs is
                    the growth of e-commerce. Companies are becoming more reliant on functioning websites that operate
                    on
                    multiple devices to do business.</p>
                <h2>How to become a web developer</h2>
                <p>A formal education isn&rsquo;t always necessary to become an entry-level web developer. Some web
                    developers have an associate or <a
                        href="https://www.coursera.org/articles/what-is-a-bachelors-degree" rel=""
                        target="_self">bachelor&rsquo;s degree</a> in website design or <a
                        href="https://www.coursera.org/articles/what-is-computer-science-degree" rel=""
                        target="_self">computer science</a>, but others teach themselves how to code and design
                    websites.
                    While earning a degree can make you a more competitive candidate, a strong portfolio can go a long
                    way
                    toward validating your skills to potential employers.</p>
                <p>If you&rsquo;re interested in becoming a web developer, here are some steps you can take.</p>
                <h3>1. Build web developer skills.</h3>
                <p>Employers and clients usually expect web developers to have certain skills that demonstrate their
                    ability
                    to deliver on website requirements. If you&rsquo;re interested in a career as a web developer, these
                    are
                    some skills you can focus on to build a foundation for success.</p>

                            do
                            back-end development.</p>

                            search
                            engine ranking. Understanding how search engines rank sites is useful in a developer&rsquo;s

                            websites.
                            They should have the patience and ability to identify problems in the design or coding and
                            solve
                            them in a methodical way.</p>

            <h3>2. Consider a degree in computer science or web design.</h3>
            <p>While you don&rsquo;t always need a degree to get a job in web development, it can certainly help. If
                you&rsquo;re already in school (or considering earning a degree), some majors might be a better fit for
                your
                career goals than others. If you&rsquo;re more interested in back-end web development, consider a degree
                program in computer science. If you feel more drawn to front-end development, you might opt for a degree
                in
                web design or <a href="https://www.coursera.org/articles/what-degree-do-i-need-to-become-a-ux-designer"

            <h3>3. Take a course in web development.</h3>
            <p>You don&rsquo;t necessarily need formal training to work as a web developer. It&rsquo;s possible to
                acquire
                the skills you need on your own. For example, you can take a course to learn programming languages like
                HTML, JavaScript, or CSS, and then put what you learn into practice on your own website.</p>
            <p>By completing an online course in web development, like <a

                    Everybody: Basics of Web Development &amp; Coding</a> from the University of Michigan, you can build
                skills while completing development projects for your portfolio.</p>
