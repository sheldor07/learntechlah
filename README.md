## Inspiration

As college students, many of us are unaware as to what the future holds and how to get started on our career paths. For those with little to no prior experience, it is difficult to find internships in the fields we enjoy. We identified that the problem was not the lack of educational content available, but was instead the presence of a platform that guided users every step of the way. Thus, we have chosen this topic to help individuals gain skills and establish a foundation necessary to pursue a career path of their choice.

  

## What it does

LearnTechLah! is a one-stop platform for anyone looking to become a part of the technology industry. Our website allows users to access tutorials for various in-demand career paths, ranging from Web Development to Data Scientist.
  

Once the user has selected their specialisation of choice, they can access a course which contains all the necessary information on the topic- from basics to advanced skills. A link will be provided for the user to access the content page, which contains videos and lessons. The recordings can be rewatched how many ever times the user pleases. On completing the course, they will be prompted to create an account, alongside which they will be asked to design five projects related to the field they have selected. These projects can be submitted to companies for assessment- which could land users an internship and greatly assist in their resume.

  

## How we built it

For the frontend of the webpage, we used HTML, with the Bootstrap framework in CSS, and JQuery framework in js. For the backend, we built the server on node.js using express.js, which is connected to a mySQL database using an ORM called Sequelize.

  

## Challenges we faced

With only 48 hours on the clock, it was quite challenging to formulate a creative solution as well as create an entire webpage from scratch. The time crunch made the task more ardous, especially when the high stakes and competition were taken into consideration. There were also issues that arose with debugging the code for the backend of the page.
  

## What we learned

In the early stages of our project, we found that there was no single platform that could guide a person without coding experience all the way until they landed an internship. We strived to solve this issue. For this, we learned how to use HTML and CSS to develop an entire webpage from scratch. We also learned the importance of understanding the needs and requirements of potential customers, and implementing this in the building of our project.
